## Usage

Click on __Extensions__ > __Modules__ from the top menu. From the list of created module instances, an unpublished form was created from the installation. This can be used or you can create another form by clicking the green __New__ button at the top left of the page and selecting __Rave Payment Forms__ from the list of module types.

* __Title__ - (Required) The title of the form you want create. The title can be hidden from the view by clicking hide  button on the "Show Title" option on the right of the page.
* __Module__ tab contains form specific configuration:
  - __Amount__ The amount to charge the customer (if left blank, customer will be asked to enter amount).
  - __Use logged in user email__ Use logged-in user's email as customer email (If set to 'No', customer will be asked to enter email).
  - __Button Text__ - (Optional) The text to display on the form button. Default: "PAY NOW".
  - Other options (on the right):
    * __Position__ Set the position (place) to display the form on your site. This is dependent on the current template position. But, the module provides an extra position named __Rave In-Article__ and can be selected from the list. This lets you display the form on an article page (more below). Also, you can set (enter) a custom position.
    * __Status__ The status of the form. Set to __Published__ to have the form available for display.
* __Menu Assignment__ tab lets you select the page(s) that will have access to the form. "No pages" means the form won't be available. Recommended is "On all pages". You can use "Only on the pages selected" to restrict the form to certain pages (pages need to exist).
* Click __Save & Close__ to create (or save) the form.


### Display form in article body

To display the form within the article body, make sure you set the position for the form to __Rave In-Article__ when creating the form (Module settings). This is a position provided by default by the module to avoid conflicts with template's positions.

Click on __Content__ > __Articles__ > __Add New Article__ and give it a title and load the provided __Rave In-Article__ position by putting this in the Content Editor:

```
{loadposition Rave In-Article}
```

This will output all the content set to display at this position (Rave In-Article) here. This comes handy if you want to have multiple forms on the same page.

To have different forms on different pages, you should set a custom position for each of the forms and loading the positions in their respective articles (pages).

```
{loadposition name_of_custom_postion}
```

Note: replace `name_of_custom_postion` with the name of the diferent positions you created.

Set __Status__ to _Published_ and click __Save & Close__. That's it, you have the form on the article page. Attach the article to a Menu so you can see it.


## Transaction List ##

All the payments made through the forms to Rave can be accessed on __Components__ > __Rave Payments Forms__ > __Transaction List__ page.
